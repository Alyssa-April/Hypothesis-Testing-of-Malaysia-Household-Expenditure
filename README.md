# Hypothesis-Testing-of-Malaysia-Household-Expenditure
Statistics project

This is a group project that my teammates and I have carried out for our Statistics course. It is titled "Modelling and Inferential Analysis of Variables in the Household Expenditure Survey Of MalaysiaÂ for the Year 2014, 2016 and 2019".  The codes for the descriptive statistics of the continuous variables are available. Besides that, codes for the ANOVA hypothesis testing, adjusting for inflation and proportion hypothesis testing are also available.
